# React + Vite + Tailwind + Express Starter (v2)

**Now with Zustand for global state and PostgreSQL support**

## Overview

This is an enhanced version of the original [Luckenbach](https://github.com/goodalchemy/react-vite-tailwind-express-starter), a simple yet powerful starter template for building web apps with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Express.

In this version, we've added:

- **Zustand** for lightweight global state management
- **pg** for PostgreSQL database integration
- Other refinements to improve full-stack development

This setup remains **flexible, fast, and easy to deploy**, making it ideal for SaaS apps, dashboards, and internal tools.

## Why This?

Frameworks like Next.js and Remix add a lot of power but also a lot of complexity. If you just need a **lean, full-stack React + Express setup**, this template keeps things simple while giving you full control.

In the spirit of Waylon Jennings’ _Luckenbach, Texas_:

> _Maybe it’s time we got back to the basics of love._
