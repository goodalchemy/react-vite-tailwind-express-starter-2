# React + Vite + Tailwind + Express Starter

## Overview

A flexible starter template for building web apps with React, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Express—without the complexity of meta-frameworks like Next.js or Remix. This setup prioritizes simplicity, control, and performance, making it ideal for SaaS apps, dashboards, and internal tools.

While Next.js and Remix shine for content-driven sites, their abstractions can add unnecessary overhead for web apps. This template keeps things lean: a single Express server seamlessly serving both frontend and API for easier deployment and maintenance.

## 🎵 Back to the Basics of React

Modern React development often feels overcomplicated. While abstractions have their place, sometimes you just need a simple, flexible setup without unnecessary constraints.

In the spirit of Waylon Jennings’ _Luckenbach, Texas_:

> Maybe it’s time we got back to the basics of love.

Let’s strip away the bloat and focus on what matters: building great React apps with Vite, TailwindCSS, and Express—without the extra noise.

## client

To create the `client/` folder - our React frontend - we ran the Vite setup command inside the project, choosing "React" as the framework:

`npm create vite@latest`

We also chose **Javascript + SWC** during setup as well, which we recommend.

## Development

We use **concurrently** in development to run both the frontend and server simultaneously. During development, the full app (frontend + server) is available at localhost:3000, while the frontend alone runs at localhost:5173 with hot module reloading. If you're only making frontend or styling changes, localhost:5173 is the better option for a faster workflow.

In production, only the server needs to be running.

## Benefits

- **No Framework Lock-in** – Customize your app structure without Next.js or Remix constraints.
- **Unified Full-Stack Setup** – Serve frontend and API from the same Express server.
- **Efficient Development** – Vite ensures fast builds and hot reloading.
- **TailwindCSS for Styling** – Quickly create responsive designs.
- **No TypeScript** – This project sticks to JavaScript for simplicity, speed, and fewer dependencies. TypeScript can add unnecessary overhead for small to medium projects, but you're free to add it if needed.
- **Simple Deployment** – Easily deploy to a single server or separate services as needed.

## API Development with Express

Define routes under `src/routes/`. Example:

```js
// src/routes/hello.js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/hello", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Hello World!" });
});

module.exports = router;
```

On the homepage - `/client/page/Home.js` - you will see an example of making a call to your server API from the frontend.

Going forward, you will likely want to enhance these fetches with support from packages like **zustand** for global state management and **@tanstack/react-query** for caching/refetching.

### Deployment Options

- **VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2)**
- **Heroku** – Use a single **Procfile**
- **Railway, Fly.io, Render.com**

As of right now, we highly recommend Render.com for their ease of use, reliability, and strong range of offerings - especially their Postgres plans. This is not an ad, we just really like them.

## Conclusion

This setup keeps things simple and flexible. Modify as needed and deploy where it suits you.
